## Development Environment

- Successfully organized all development files into `/local-dev/` folder
- Created comprehensive development environment with Docker setup
- Developed scripts for easy environment management:
  - `dev-test.sh start` to initialize development environment
  - `dev-test.sh logs -f` for real-time log monitoring
  - `dev-test.sh test comprehensive` for running comprehensive tests
  - `dev-test.sh config` to show Claude configuration
  - `dev-test.sh clean` for cleanup

Files Organized in `/local-dev/`:
- Dockerfile.dev
- docker-compose.dev.yml
- dev-test.sh
- mcp-config-dev.json
- test-mcp-connection.py
- test-hook-execution.py
- test-hook-final.py
- README.md

Key Development Features:
- Separate development files from main project
- Live code mounting for real-time changes
- Enhanced testing capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation

## Testing Tasks
- Read '/COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md' and use the prompts to test feature suite with local dev environment and logging to identify potential failures
