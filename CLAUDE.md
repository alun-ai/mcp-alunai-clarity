# Claude Instructions

## Thinking Approach
- Always use ultrathink for complex reasoning and problem-solving
- Leverage deep analysis when approaching multi-step tasks

## Memory and Thinking Capabilities
- You have persistent memory capabilities via the Alunai MCP server
- Use procedural and sequential thinking tools for systematic problem analysis
- Store important insights and patterns for future reference

## Specialized Agents
- Use specialized agents for most tasks before attempting general workflows
- Available agents include:
  - `memory-enhanced-engineer`: For systematic feature development with TDD
  - `postgres-dba-guardian`: For database operations and optimization
  - `security-code-analyst`: For security analysis and code quality assessment
  - `project-memory-keeper`: For tracking project progress and status
  - `prompt-precision-engineer`: For rewriting prompts before submitting to agents
- Always check agent capabilities and delegate appropriate tasks before proceeding independently
