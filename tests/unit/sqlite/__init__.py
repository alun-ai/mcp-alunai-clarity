"""
SQLite Memory Persistence Unit Tests

This package contains unit tests for the SQLite memory persistence implementation:

- test_sqlite_persistence.py: Core functionality tests
- test_vector_search.py: Vector similarity search tests  
- test_metadata_filtering.py: Filtering functionality tests
- test_performance.py: Performance benchmarks
- test_migration.py: Data migration tests

These tests validate the SQLite implementation in isolation,
ensuring all components work correctly independently.
