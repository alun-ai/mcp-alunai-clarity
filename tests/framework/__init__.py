"""
Comprehensive Test Framework for MCP SQLite Integration Validation.

This framework provides systematic testing utilities for:
1. Memory persistence validation - ensuring SQLite data accuracy and consistency
2. MCP protocol validation - testing complete request-response cycles
3. End-to-end integration testing - validating both MCP and underlying data

Components:
- MCPServerTestSuite: Tests MCP protocol compliance and integration  
- MCPProtocolValidator: MCP response format validation

Note: Qdrant-specific validation components have been removed as part of 
      the migration to SQLite-based persistence.
