## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Session Not Tracked:**
- **Cause:** Missing or invalid session ID
- **Solution:** Ensure consistent session_id across all stages
- **Prevention:** Use same session_id parameter for all related thoughts

**Missing Relationships:**
- **Cause:** Relationship parameters not provided
- **Solution:** Add relationship metadata linking stages
- **Prevention:** Use structured relationship format in thought processing

**Summary Not Generated:**
- **Cause:** Insufficient session data or missing stages
- **Solution:** Ensure multiple thinking stages are processed before summary
- **Prevention:** Complete at least 3 stages before requesting summary

### **Performance Issues**

**Slow Summary Generation:**
- **Normal:** Summary generation can take 10-15 seconds for complex sessions
- **Check:** Ensure all stage memories are properly indexed
- **Optimize:** Allow processing time between stages

**Memory Storage Delays:**
- **Normal:** Each thinking stage may take 2-3 seconds to store
- **Check:** Monitor hook execution timing
- **Validate:** Confirm memory count increases after each stage

## 💡 Testing Tips

### **Sequential Processing**
- Run stages in logical order: Problem Definition → Research → Analysis
- Allow 5-10 seconds between stages for processing
- Use consistent session ID throughout the thinking process

### **Session Validation**
- Check session insights after each stage
- Verify relationship mapping is building correctly
- Confirm memory storage before proceeding to next stage

### **Summary Generation**
- Only request summary after processing multiple stages
- Allow 15-20 seconds for comprehensive summary generation
- Verify automatic session summary storage in memory system
