# 🔍 Proactive Memory System Test Suite

**Testing automatic context-aware memory consultation and proactive intelligence**

⏱️ **Estimated Duration:** 90 seconds

## 🎯 Test Objectives

Validate the proactive memory capabilities that enable automatic, context-aware memory consultation:

- Automatic memory query suggestions based on current context
- Context-aware memory retrieval without explicit requests
- Proactive memory configuration and customization
- Hook integration for proactive memory triggers
- Similarity threshold filtering and effectiveness

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 4.1: Automatic Memory Query Suggestions

**Purpose:** Generate intelligent memory query suggestions based on current conversation context

**Test Command:**
```
Suggest relevant memory queries I should run based on our current notification system discussion
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Context-aware query suggestions
- ✅ Relevance scoring above 0.6
- ✅ Multiple query variations provided
- ✅ Hook execution logged
- ✅ Task-specific query optimization

**Success Criteria:**
- Suggestions relate to notification system context
- Multiple query variations provided (typically 3-5)
- Relevance scoring shows meaningful assessment
- Query suggestions are actionable and specific
- Hook execution timing recorded

### Test 4.2: Automatic Relevant Memory Retrieval

**Purpose:** Automatically find and present relevant memories without explicit search

**Test Command:**
```
Check for any relevant memories related to real-time systems, WebSocket implementations, or notification patterns from our previous work
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Automatic context analysis
- ✅ Multi-query execution if enabled
- ✅ Relevant memory presentation
- ✅ Similarity threshold filtering
- ✅ Hook triggered for memory consultation

**Success Criteria:**
- Context analysis identifies key topics automatically
- Relevant memories retrieved from previous sessions
- Similarity threshold filtering applied (typically > 0.6)
- Memory presentation includes similarity scores
- Hook execution for automatic consultation

---

### Test 4.3: Proactive Memory Configuration

**Purpose:** Configure proactive memory behavior and validate settings application

**Test Command:**
```
Configure proactive memory to auto-present relevant memories when I access files or run commands, with similarity threshold of 0.7
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Configuration stored in system memory
- ✅ Hook manager updated with new settings
- ✅ Memory system reconfigured
- ✅ Confirmation of settings applied
- ✅ Hook execution tracked

**Success Criteria:**
- Configuration changes accepted and applied
- Similarity threshold set to 0.7 as requested
- Hook manager updated with new trigger settings
- System confirmation of configuration changes
- Settings persistence verified

**Validation Command:**
```
Show current proactive memory configuration and status
```

**Should confirm:** Similarity threshold = 0.7, auto-present enabled, hook triggers active

- [ ] Task-specific optimization in suggestions
- [ ] Hook execution for suggestion generation

### **Automatic Retrieval ✅**
- [ ] Context analysis identifies key topics
- [ ] Relevant memories retrieved without explicit search
- [ ] Similarity filtering applied correctly
- [ ] Memory consultation hooks triggered
- [ ] Results presented with similarity scores

### **Configuration Management ✅**
- [ ] Proactive memory settings configurable
- [ ] Configuration changes applied immediately
- [ ] Hook manager updated with new settings

- [ ] Status monitoring and reporting functional

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**No Query Suggestions:**
- **Cause:** Insufficient conversation context
- **Solution:** Provide more detailed discussion context
- **Prevention:** Engage in substantive conversation before requesting suggestions

**Empty Memory Retrieval:**
- **Cause:** No relevant memories exist or similarity threshold too high
- **Solution:** Lower similarity threshold or build more memory history
- **Prevention:** Accumulate diverse memories over multiple sessions

**Configuration Not Applied:**
- **Cause:** Configuration parameters invalid or system error
- **Solution:** Verify configuration parameters and retry
- **Prevention:** Use recommended threshold values (0.6-0.8)

### **Performance Issues**

**Slow Query Generation:**
- **Normal:** Context analysis may take 5-10 seconds
- **Expected:** Complex contexts require more processing time
- **Optimization:** Results are cached for similar contexts

**Proactive Memory Overhead:**
- **Monitor:** Hook execution timing should be < 100ms
- **Expected:** Slight delay during file access or command execution
- **Acceptable:** Up to 10% performance overhead for proactive features

## 💡 Testing Tips

### **Context Building**
- Engage in detailed conversation before testing suggestions
- Use specific technical terms and project details
- Build context over multiple interactions for better suggestions

### **Memory History**
- Proactive memory works best with diverse memory history
- Store memories on various topics for better retrieval testing
- Use different memory types to test filtering capabilities

### **Configuration Testing**
- Test with different similarity thresholds (0.5, 0.7, 0.9)
- Verify configuration persistence across system restarts
- Monitor proactive presentation during normal workflow

**🎯 Expected Total Test Time:** 1.5-2 minutes including processing delays

## 📊 Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Intelligence:** Context-aware suggestions generated with relevance scoring
- [ ] **Automation:** Memories retrieved automatically without explicit search
- [ ] **Configuration:** Settings applied and persisted correctly
- [ ] **Performance:** Hook execution timing within acceptable limits
- [ ] **Integration:** Proactive memory enhances workflow without disruption

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration Options

### **Similarity Thresholds**
- **0.5-0.6:** Broad matching, more results, some false positives
- **0.7-0.8:** Balanced matching, good relevance, moderate results
- **0.9+:** Strict matching, high precision, fewer results

### **Trigger Types**
- **File Access:** Present memories when files are accessed
- **Command Execution:** Show relevant memories before commands
- **Context Changes:** Detect topic shifts and suggest related memories
- **Tool Usage:** Provide context-aware memories for specific tools
