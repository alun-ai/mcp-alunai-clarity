# 🚀 Enhanced Structured Thinking Validation Suite

**Real user validation for the enhanced structured thinking system that matches memory system sophistication**

⏱️ **Estimated Duration:** 420 seconds (7 minutes)

## 🎯 Enhanced Features Being Tested

This validation suite tests the four major enhancements that bring structured thinking to memory-system-level sophistication:

1. **Auto-Stage Progression** (like memory's auto-retrieval)
2. **Proactive Thinking Suggestions** (like memory's query suggestions) 
3. **Enhanced Problem Component Detection** (like memory's pattern recognition)
4. **Smart Context Integration** (like memory's multi-dimensional analysis)
