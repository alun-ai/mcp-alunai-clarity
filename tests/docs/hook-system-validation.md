Search for automatically generated session summaries from the last few minutes
```

**Success Criteria:**
- **Should find:** Auto-generated session summary with conversation analysis
- Session summary includes key conversation elements
- Memory storage confirmed with appropriate memory type
- Hook execution timing within acceptable limits
- Session reset properly acknowledged

### Test 6.2: Hook Execution Verification

**Purpose:** Verify comprehensive hook execution tracking and performance monitoring

**Test Command:**
```
Show me statistics on hook executions and automatic memory storage over this testing session
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Hook execution count by tool
- ✅ Automatic memory storage confirmations
- ✅ Session summary generation count
- ✅ Performance impact analysis
- ✅ Hook manager status

**Success Criteria:**
- Hook execution statistics show activity for all tested tools
- Automatic memory storage confirmations present
- Session summary generation count > 0
- Performance impact within acceptable range (< 10% overhead)
- Hook manager shows healthy status

### Test 6.3: End-to-End Workflow Validation

**Purpose:** Complete workflow testing from memory storage through automatic session summary

**Complete Workflow Steps:**

**Step 1 - Store Complex Decision:**
```
Store this architectural decision: "We decided to use event sourcing for our order management system because it provides complete audit trails, enables time-travel debugging, and supports complex business rule validation. Implementation will use EventStore with CQRS pattern."
```

**Step 2 - Generate Summary:**
```
Generate a summary of our architectural decision discussion
```

**Step 3 - Verify Automatic Storage:**
```
Verify that this conversation was automatically stored as a session summary
```

**Expected Complete Flow:**
- ✅ Initial memory stored with hooks
- ✅ Summary generation triggers conversation end
- ✅ Automatic session summary created
- ✅ All memories searchable and retrievable
- ✅ Complete audit trail maintained

**Success Criteria:**
- All three steps execute successfully
- Memory storage hooks triggered for initial decision
- Summary generation creates conversation end trigger
- Session summary automatically stored and retrievable
- Complete workflow traceable through audit trail

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Session Summaries Not Generated:**
- **Cause:** Conversation end hook not properly triggered
- **Solution:** Verify hook system is enabled and conversation_end hooks registered
- **Debug:** Check hook execution logs for conversation end events

**Missing Hook Execution:**
- **Cause:** Hook manager not initialized or tool hooks not registered
- **Solution:** Restart system and verify hook registration
- **Prevention:** Monitor hook manager status regularly

**Performance Issues:**
- **Cause:** Hook execution overhead too high
- **Solution:** Check individual hook execution timing
- **Acceptable:** Hook overhead should be < 10% of operation time

### **Session Summary Issues**

**Summaries Not Searchable:**
- **Cause:** Memory indexing delay or incorrect memory type
- **Solution:** Wait 30 seconds for indexing, search for session_summary type
- **Alternative:** Check memory statistics for session summary count

**Incomplete Session Data:**
- **Cause:** Session data not properly captured
- **Solution:** Verify that conversation has sufficient activity for summary
- **Requirement:** Minimum 3 interactions typically needed for meaningful summary

**Hook Chain Failures:**
- **Cause:** One hook in chain failing, breaking subsequent hooks
- **Solution:** Check hook execution logs for specific failures
- **Recovery:** Individual hook failures should not break entire system

### **Performance Degradation**

**Slow Hook Execution:**
- **Acceptable:** Individual hooks < 100ms execution time
- **Concerning:** Hook execution > 200ms consistently
- **Critical:** Hook execution > 500ms (investigate immediately)

**Memory Storage Delays:**
- **Normal:** 1-3 seconds for complex memory storage with hooks
- **Concerning:** > 5 seconds for simple operations
- **Check:** Verify Qdrant collection health and performance

## 💡 Testing Tips

### **Hook System Testing**
- Always verify hook execution through statistics, not just operation success
- Allow time for asynchronous hook processing (2-5 seconds)
- Check memory statistics for evidence of automatic storage
- Monitor hook execution timing for performance issues

### **Session Summary Validation**
- Session summaries may use different memory types (session_summary, conversation_summary, etc.)
- Check memory statistics for increases in summary-related memory types
- Search with broad terms initially, then narrow down based on found content
- Allow 15-30 seconds for complex session analysis and storage

### **End-to-End Workflow Testing**
- Execute workflow steps with brief pauses (5 seconds) between steps
- Verify each step completes successfully before proceeding
- Check both immediate results and downstream effects (automatic storage)
- Use specific, memorable content for easier verification

**🎯 Expected Total Test Time:** 2-3 minutes including processing delays

## 📊 Hook Performance Benchmarks

### **Acceptable Hook Execution Times**
- **Memory Operations:** < 50ms per hook
- **Session Analysis:** < 200ms per hook
- **Conversation End:** < 500ms per hook (complex processing)
- **Summary Generation:** < 1000ms per hook (comprehensive analysis)

### **System Health Indicators**
- **Hook Success Rate:** > 95% successful execution
- **Performance Overhead:** < 10% of total operation time
- **Memory Storage Rate:** 100% of intended automatic storage
- **Audit Trail Completeness:** All operations traceable

## 🔍 Advanced Hook Debugging

### **Hook Execution Monitoring**
```
Monitor hook execution in real-time during testing
Check hook manager status before and after operations
Verify hook registration for all 26 MCP tools
Track performance metrics throughout testing session
```

### **Session Summary Analysis**
```
Analyze content and structure of generated session summaries
Verify summary completeness and accuracy
Check memory type assignment for session summaries
Validate searchability and retrieval of stored summaries
```

This hook system validation ensures that the critical automatic memory storage functionality (the original core requirement) is working correctly and reliably.
