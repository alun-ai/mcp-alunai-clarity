2. **Verify Hook Registration:**
   ```
   Show hook system status - ensure conversation_end hook is registered
   ```

3. **Test Summary Generation:**
   ```
   Manually generate session summary and verify storage capability
   ```

### If Memory Hooks Not Triggering:
1. **Validate Hook Configuration:**
   ```
   Check proactive memory configuration and hook enablement status
   ```

2. **Test Individual Hook Types:**
   ```
   Test store_memory, retrieve_memory, and other operations individually
   ```

3. **Check Hook Execution Logs:**
   ```
   Review hook execution timing and error logs for failures
   ```

### Performance Issues:
1. **Measure Hook Overhead:**
   ```
   Execute operations with and without hooks to measure performance impact
   ```

2. **Check Hook Queue Status:**
   ```
   Verify hook execution queue is not backing up
   ```

This focused hook validation suite ensures the automatic memory storage and conversation lifecycle management is working correctly.
