# üöÄ AutoCode Intelligence Test Suite

**Testing intelligent coding assistance, pattern detection, and learning progression tracking**

‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated Duration:** 150 seconds

## üéØ Test Objectives

Validate the AutoCode intelligence capabilities that provide context-aware coding assistance:

- Project pattern detection and analysis
- Intelligent command suggestions with structured thinking
- Learning progression tracking across sessions
- Framework and technology identification
- Historical pattern matching for recommendations

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test 3.1: Project Pattern Detection

**Purpose:** Analyze current project to detect technologies, frameworks, and coding patterns

**Test Command:**
```
Analyze the current project patterns and architecture - what technologies, frameworks, and coding patterns do you detect?
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Python framework detection (FastAPI/Flask)
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol architecture
- ‚úÖ Docker containerization patterns
- ‚úÖ Vector database integration (Qdrant)
- ‚úÖ Hook trigger for pattern analysis
- ‚úÖ Confidence scores for each detection

**Success Criteria:**
- Detects Python as primary language
- Identifies MCP server architecture pattern
- Recognizes containerization setup (Docker)
- Identifies vector database usage (Qdrant)
- Provides confidence scores for each detected pattern
- Hook execution timing recorded

### Test 3.2: Intelligent Command Suggestions

**Purpose:** Generate context-aware command suggestions with structured thinking analysis

**Test Command:**
```
I want to add a caching layer to improve memory retrieval performance. Use structured thinking analysis for complex suggestions.
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Context-aware command suggestions
- ‚úÖ Confidence scoring based on project patterns  
- ‚úÖ Structured thinking analysis applied
- ‚úÖ Historical pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Framework-specific recommendations
- ‚úÖ Hook execution with timing

**Success Criteria:**
- Suggestions are relevant to current project architecture
- Recommendations include specific technologies (Redis, Memcached, etc.)
- Confidence scores provided for each suggestion
- Structured thinking applied to complex scenarios
- Historical patterns considered in recommendations
- Framework-specific implementation details provided

### Test 3.3: Learning Progression Tracking

**Purpose:** Track learning and skill development across coding sessions

**Test Command:**
```
Show me our learning progression on MCP server development over the past sessions
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Session analysis with skill progression
- ‚úÖ Knowledge evolution tracking
- ‚úÖ Pattern recognition improvements
- ‚úÖ Hook triggered for analytics
- ‚úÖ Timeline of learning milestones

**Success Criteria:**

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Pattern Detection Failures:**
- **Cause:** Project path not accessible or invalid
- **Solution:** Verify project path exists and is readable
- **Prevention:** Use absolute paths and check permissions

**No Command Suggestions:**
- **Cause:** Insufficient context or project information
- **Solution:** Provide more detailed project context
- **Prevention:** Ensure project patterns are detected first

**Empty Learning Progression:**
- **Cause:** No historical session data available
- **Solution:** Run multiple sessions to build learning history
- **Prevention:** Allow system to accumulate session data over time

### **Performance Issues**

**Slow Pattern Detection:**
- **Normal:** Large projects may take 15-30 seconds to analyze
- **Optimization:** Pattern detection caches results for faster subsequent access
- **Monitoring:** Check hook execution timing for bottlenecks

**Command Suggestion Delays:**
- **Normal:** Structured thinking analysis adds 10-15 seconds
- **Expected:** Complex suggestions require more processing time
- **Validation:** Verify suggestions are more detailed and accurate

## üí° Testing Tips

### **Pattern Detection**
- Ensure you're in the correct project directory
- Allow time for comprehensive project scanning
- Check that detected patterns match actual project structure
- Verify confidence scores are reasonable (typically 0.6-0.9)

### **Command Suggestions**
- Provide clear, specific intent in your requests
- Use structured thinking for complex implementation scenarios
- Compare suggestions against actual project needs
- Validate that suggestions consider existing project patterns

### **Learning Progression**
- Requires multiple sessions to show meaningful progression
- Most useful after 3-5 coding sessions with the system
- Look for improvements in pattern recognition accuracy over time
- Check that learning milestones align with actual development progress

**üéØ Expected Total Test Time:** 2.5-3 minutes including pattern analysis delays
