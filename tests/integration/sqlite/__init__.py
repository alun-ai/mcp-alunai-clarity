SQLite Memory Persistence Integration Tests

This package contains integration tests for the SQLite memory persistence implementation:

- test_mcp_sqlite_integration.py: MCP server integration tests
- test_concurrent_access.py: Multi-process safety tests
- test_fallback_mechanisms.py: Error handling and recovery tests

These tests validate the SQLite implementation in real-world scenarios,
ensuring proper integration with the MCP server and robust error handling.
