## üö® **Failure Investigation Protocol**

If any test fails:

1. **Check Hook Manager Status:**
   ```
   Show hook manager status and recent hook executions
   ```

2. **Verify Tool Hook Triggers:**
   ```
   Test a simple store_memory command and verify hook execution
   ```

3. **Validate Conversation End Detection:**
   ```
   Manually trigger conversation end and check for session summary creation
   ```

4. **Memory Storage Verification:**
   ```  
   Search for memories created in the last 10 minutes and verify all tools generated memories
   ```

5. **CRITICAL - Functional Search Validation:**
   ```
   Store a test memory: "Vector search functionality test with unique identifier XYZ123"
   Then immediately search for: "vector search test XYZ123"
   ```
   **Must retrieve the stored memory with similarity > 0.6**

6. **Performance Baseline:**
   ```
   Run qdrant_performance_stats but IGNORE "search_functional": false and "indexed_memories" warnings
   Focus on: collection_status: "green", total_memories count, estimated_search_time_ms < 1.0
   ```

## üìã **Critical Testing Reminders**

**‚ö†Ô∏è VECTOR SEARCH VALIDATION:**
- **NEVER** rely solely on performance stats to determine if search is working
- Message "unreliable for small datasets with HNSW" is NORMAL optimization behavior
- **ALWAYS** test actual search functionality with semantic queries
- Similarity scores > 0.6 indicate proper vector search operation

**‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE INTERPRETATION:**
- `"search_functional": false` may appear due to HNSW optimizations - this is NOT a failure indicator
- `"indexed_memories": "N/A"` is normal for optimized small datasets
- Focus on `collection_status: "green"` and actual query results

This comprehensive test suite validates every aspect of the Alunai Clarity system and ensures that the automatic memory storage functionality (the original issue) is working correctly.
