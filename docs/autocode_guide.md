# AutoCodeIndex Guide

The AutoCodeIndex system is an intelligent code project assistance platform integrated with MCP Persistent Memory. It provides Claude with sophisticated understanding of code patterns, project structures, command usage, and session history to enhance development workflows.

## Overview

AutoCodeIndex transforms Claude into an intelligent coding assistant that learns from your development patterns and provides contextual assistance. It operates completely automatically through MCP hooks, requiring no manual intervention while building a comprehensive understanding of your coding practices.

## Features

### üß† Intelligent Command Assistance

AutoCodeIndex learns from your command usage patterns and provides smart suggestions:

- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Commands recommended based on project type, platform, and current context
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitors which commands work best in different situations
- **Retry Pattern Detection**: Automatically identifies and suggests fixes for failed command patterns
- **Platform Intelligence**: Provides platform-specific optimizations for macOS, Linux, and Windows

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "I need to delete this directory"
Claude: Based on your platform and past usage, I suggest: `rm -rf directory_name`
This command has a 95% success rate in similar contexts.
```

### üîç Project Pattern Recognition

Automatically detects and indexes project patterns across multiple languages and frameworks:

**Supported Frameworks:**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte
- **Backend**: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express.js, Rails
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup, esbuild

**Pattern Detection:**
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, component-based, layered, microservices, hexagonal
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case consistency analysis
- **Component Relationships**: Dependency mapping and import/export analysis
- **Testing Patterns**: Jest, Pytest, Cargo test, and framework-specific testing

**Example:**
```
You: "Analyze this project structure"
Claude: I've detected a React + TypeScript project with:
- Component-based architecture
- camelCase naming convention (98% consistent)
- Material-UI design system
- Jest testing setup
- Recommended next steps: Add Storybook for component documentation
```

### üìà Session History & Context

Advanced conversation analysis provides intelligent session navigation:

**Session Analysis:**
- **Task Tracking**: Automatically identifies completed, in-progress, and failed tasks
- **Learning Moments**: Captures insights, discoveries, and knowledge gaps
- **Architectural Decisions**: Records design choices and their reasoning
- **File Modification Tracking**: Monitors code changes and their context

**Context Continuation:**
- **Seamless Resumption**: Pick up exactly where you left off in previous sessions
- **Relevant Context**: Automatically provides background from similar past work
- **Pattern Reuse**: Suggests approaches that worked well in similar situations

**Example:**
```
You: "Continue working on the user authentication system"
Claude: Based on our previous session 3 days ago, you were implementing JWT tokens 
with refresh logic. I see you completed the login endpoint and were working on 
the password reset flow. The approach using bcrypt and nodemailer was successful.
Shall we continue with the email verification component?
```

### üìä Learning Progression Tracking

Monitor your development skills and knowledge growth over time:

**Tracked Metrics:**
- **Technology Mastery**: Progress on specific languages, frameworks, and tools
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Evolution of your debugging and implementation approaches  
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where you consistently need assistance
- **Skill Development**: Improvement trends across different technologies

**Example:**
```
You: "Show my React learning progression"
Claude: Over the past 3 months, I've tracked significant growth:
- Advanced from functional components to custom hooks (mastered useCallback, useMemo)
- Performance optimization skills improved 40% (React.memo, code splitting)
- State management evolved from useState to Context API to Zustand
- Current focus areas: React Query, testing with React Testing Library
- Suggestion: Ready to explore advanced patterns like render props and compound components
```

### ‚ö° Workflow Optimization

Continuous improvement suggestions based on historical patterns:

**Optimization Areas:**
- **Command Efficiency**: Streamlined command sequences for common tasks
- **Development Workflows**: Improved development, testing, and deployment processes
- **Tool Usage**: Better utilization of development tools and shortcuts
- **Architecture Decisions**: Patterns that scale well based on past project success

**Example:**
```
Claude: I've noticed you often run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. 
Based on your project patterns, I suggest creating this alias:
`alias quickstart="npm install && npm run dev"`
This could save you 15-20 seconds per startup based on your usage patterns.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Optimize AutoCodeIndex Performance

**Project Organization:**
- Use consistent project structure across similar projects
- Follow established naming conventions for better pattern recognition
- Keep configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt) up to date

**Command Usage:**
- Use descriptive commit messages for better session analysis
- Group related commands together for workflow optimization
- Document complex command sequences with comments

### 2. Maximize Learning Benefits

**Explicit Learning:**
- Ask Claude to explain decisions and provide learning insights
- Request comparisons between different approaches
- Seek recommendations for skill development areas

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Work on similar projects to build strong pattern recognition
- Experiment with different approaches to the same problem
- Ask for architecture reviews and pattern analysis

### 3. Effective Session Management

**Session Continuity:**
- Start sessions with clear context about what you want to accomplish
- Reference previous work when continuing multi-session projects
- End sessions with explicit summary of what was accomplished

**Context Building:**
- Provide project context when switching between different codebases
- Mention relevant constraints, requirements, and goals
- Update Claude on any external changes or decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AutoCodeIndex Not Working:**
1. Check that `autocode.enabled` is set to `true` in configuration
2. Verify memory system is properly initialized
3. Check logs for any initialization errors

**Pattern Detection Not Accurate:**
1. Ensure project has recognizable structure (package.json, etc.)
2. Check `supported_languages` includes your project's languages
3. Verify `max_scan_depth` allows scanning your project structure

**Command Suggestions Not Helpful:**
1. Increase `min_confidence_threshold` for higher quality suggestions
2. Check that command execution tracking is enabled
3. Build more command history by using Claude for development tasks

**Session Analysis Missing Data:**
1. Ensure `min_session_length` threshold is appropriate
2. Check that `track_architectural_decisions` is enabled
3. Verify conversations include enough technical detail for analysis

### Performance Optimization

**Large Projects:**
- Adjust `max_scan_depth` to balance thoroughness with performance
- Use `ignore_patterns` to exclude unnecessary directories
- Consider enabling only specific AutoCodeIndex features for very large codebases

**Memory Usage:**
- Adjust `history_retention` settings to manage storage
- Periodically clean old session summaries and command patterns
- Monitor memory usage through `autocode_stats` tool

**Analysis Speed:**
- Reduce `context_window_days` for faster similarity searches
- Lower `similarity_threshold` to reduce computation time
- Disable unused features to improve overall performance
