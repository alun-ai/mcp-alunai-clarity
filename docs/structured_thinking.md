# Structured Thinking Integration

## Overview

Alunai Clarity now includes **Sequential Thinking Integration** that brings systematic problem-solving capabilities to AI workflows. This feature implements a 5-stage structured thinking process that helps Claude approach complex problems with methodical analysis and comprehensive understanding.

## üß† Core Concepts

### 5-Stage Thinking Process

The structured thinking system follows a proven 5-stage approach:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly define the problem, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Research** - Gather information about similar problems and relevant patterns
3. **Analysis** - Break down components, identify relationships and patterns
4. **Synthesis** - Combine insights to formulate solutions and approaches
5. **Conclusion** - Make final decisions and identify concrete action items

### Key Components

- **StructuredThought**: Individual thoughts with comprehensive metadata
- **ThinkingSession**: Collection of related thoughts with progress tracking
- **ThoughtRelationship**: Connections between thoughts (builds_on, challenges, supports, etc.)
- **ThinkingAnalyzer**: Analysis utilities for relationship patterns and confidence scoring
- **Action Plans**: Convert thinking sessions into concrete implementation steps

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools

### Basic Structured Thinking Session

```python
# Start a new thinking session
session_id = await process_structured_thought(
    stage="problem_definition",
    content="Need to implement user authentication for the web application",
    thought_number=1,
    tags=["authentication", "security", "web_app"]
)

# Continue with research
await process_structured_thought(
    stage="research",
    content="Found similar JWT-based auth patterns in memory. OAuth2 also relevant.",
    thought_number=2,
    session_id=session_id,
    relationships=[{
        "target_thought_id": "thought_1",
        "relationship_type": "builds_on",
