# AutoCode Domain Enhancements

## Overview

The AutoCode domain has been significantly enhanced with **Structured Thinking Integration**, bringing systematic problem-solving capabilities to code intelligence workflows. These enhancements apply the 5-stage structured thinking process to command suggestions, project analysis, and coding session management.

## üß† Core Enhancements

### StructuredThinkingExtension Class

A new comprehensive extension that adds structured thinking capabilities to the AutoCode domain:

**Location**: `clarity/autocode/structured_thinking_extension.py`

**Key Features:**
- **Problem Analysis**: 5-stage structured thinking for coding problems
- **Session Management**: Create and track thinking sessions  
- **Guidance Systems**: Stage-specific guidance and recommendations
- **Action Plans**: Convert abstract thinking to concrete coding steps
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate potential coding risks

## üîß Enhanced Tools

### Enhanced `suggest_command`

The command suggestion tool now includes optional structured thinking analysis for complex intents.

**New Parameter**: `use_structured_thinking` (boolean, optional)

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "intent": "implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens",
  "context": {
    "project_type": "web_application", 
    "framework": "django",
    "complexity": "high"
  },
  "use_structured_thinking": true
}
```

**Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "intent": "implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "command": "python manage.py startapp authentication",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Creates dedicated auth app following Django best practices",
      "thinking_analysis": {
        "session_id": "auth_analysis_20240121_143022",
        "confidence_boost": 0.1,
        "research_backing": 3,
        "component_analysis": {
          "components": ["API integration", "Data persistence", "Testing strategy"],
          "tags": ["authentication", "security", "api"],
          "axioms": ["APIs should be treated as external dependencies"],
          "assumptions": ["API will remain stable"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_suggestions": 4
}
```

**Complexity Detection Logic:**
Commands use structured thinking when:
- Intent has more than 5 words (multi-word complexity)
- Context has more than 3 fields (rich context)
- Keywords like "implement", "design", "architecture", "solution" are present
- Project type indicates complexity ("enterprise", "complex", "multi-service")

### Enhanced `get_project_patterns`

Project pattern detection now applies structured thinking for deeper analysis.

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "project_path": "/path/to/web-application"
}
```

**Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "framework": {
    "primary": "django",
    "version": "4.2",
    "confidence": 0.85
  },
  "language": {
    "primary": "python",
    "distribution": {"python": 0.8, "javascript": 0.2}
  },
  "structured_analysis": {
    "thinking_session_id": "pattern_analysis_20240121_143045",
    "analysis_depth": "structured_thinking_applied",
    "pattern_confidence": 0.92,
    "research_insights": [
      "Found 3 similar Django projects in memory",
      "Authentication patterns identified",
      "REST API structure detected"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Confidence Calculation:**
Pattern confidence is enhanced by:
- Base detection confidence + research findings boost (up to +0.3)
- Analysis components boost (up to +0.2)
- Maximum confidence capped at 1.0

## üéØ Structured Thinking Workflows

### Problem Analysis with Stages

The `analyze_problem_with_stages` method processes coding problems through systematic stages:

**Stage 1: Problem Definition**
```python
problem_thought = StructuredThought(
    thought_number=1,
    total_expected=5,
    stage=ThinkingStage.PROBLEM_DEFINITION,
    content="Problem: implement secure user authentication",
    tags=["problem", "analysis", "coding"],
    importance=0.8
)
```

**Stage 2: Research**
- Searches memory for similar problems
- Identifies relevant patterns and frameworks
- Documents historical approaches

**Stage 3: Analysis** 
- Breaks down problem into components
- Applies intelligent component detection
- Challenges assumptions and identifies axioms

**Component Detection Logic:**
- **API Integration**: Detects "api" keyword ‚Üí adds API components, security axioms
- **Database Operations**: Detects "database" ‚Üí adds persistence components, consistency axioms  
- **Performance Issues**: Detects "performance" ‚Üí adds optimization components, anti-premature-optimization axioms
- **Testing Requirements**: Detects "test" ‚Üí adds testing strategy components, maintainability axioms
- **Context-Based**: Adds language/framework-specific components from context

### Session Management

**Create Thinking Sessions:**
```python
session_id = await create_thinking_session(
    title="Authentication System Implementation",
    description="Systematic analysis of auth requirements"
)
```

**Session Analysis Integration:**
```python
enhanced_insights = await apply_structured_thinking_to_session_analysis({
    "title": "Coding Session Analysis", 
    "summary": "Implemented user auth with JWT tokens",
    "context": {"framework": "django", "complexity": "high"}
})
```

### Next Stage Suggestions

The system intelligently suggests next thinking stages:

```python
next_stage_info = await suggest_next_thinking_stage(session_id="session_123")
# Returns:
# {
#   "next_stage": "synthesis",
#   "reason": "Combine insights to develop solutions", 
#   "guidance": {
#     "focus": "Combine research and analysis to develop solution approaches",
#     "questions": ["What solution approach best fits constraints?"],
#     "output_format": "Prioritized list of solution approaches"
#   }
# }
```

**Stage Progression:**
1. Problem Definition ‚Üí Research
2. Research ‚Üí Analysis  
3. Analysis ‚Üí Synthesis
4. Synthesis ‚Üí Conclusion
5. Conclusion ‚Üí Complete

### Action Plan Generation

Convert structured thinking sessions into concrete coding action plans:

```python
action_plan = await generate_coding_action_plan(session_id="session_123")
```

**Generated Plan Structure:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "auth_session_123",
  "problem_statement": "Implement secure user authentication with JWT",
  "research_foundation": [
    "Relevant patterns identified",
    "Similar problems found in memory"
  ],
  "implementation_components": [
    "authentication", "security", "api", "database"
  ],
  "solution_approach": [
    "Use Django REST framework for API",
    "Implement JWT token authentication",
    "Add refresh token mechanism"
  ],
  "action_items": [
    "Set up Django authentication app",
    "Configure JWT token handling",
    "Implement secure endpoints"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Review and validate the action plan",
    "Set up development environment if needed", 
    "Begin implementation of core components"
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "Problem requirements are met",
    "Implementation follows identified patterns",
    "Code quality standards are maintained"
  ],
  "risk_mitigation": {
    "Assumption: Users always use secure passwords": "Validate assumption before proceeding",
    "Technical complexity": "Break down into smaller, manageable tasks",
    "Integration issues": "Test integrations early and frequently"
  }
}
```

## üîç Assumption Tracking

Track how assumptions evolve throughout the thinking process:

```python
assumption_evolution = await track_assumption_evolution(session_id="session_123")
```

**Evolution Analysis:**
```json
{
  "evolution_timeline": [
    {
      "thought_number": 2,
      "stage": "research", 
      "action": "challenged",
      "assumptions": ["Users always use secure passwords"],
      "context": "Research shows password vulnerabilities..."
    }
  ],
  "total_assumptions_challenged": 3,
  "most_challenged_assumptions": [
    ["Users always use secure passwords", 2],
    ["API will remain stable", 1]
  ],
  "assumptions_by_stage": {
    "research": ["Users always use secure passwords"],
    "analysis": ["API will remain stable", "Database schema is optimized"]
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure structured thinking behavior in AutoCode domain:

```json
{
  "autocode": {
    "structured_thinking": {
      "enabled": true,
      "integration_level": "enhanced"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `enabled` (boolean): Enable/disable structured thinking features (default: true)
- `integration_level` (string): "basic" or "enhanced" integration depth (default: "enhanced")

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### For Simple Commands
Standard command suggestions without structured thinking overhead:
```json
{
  "intent": "list files",
  "context": {"directory": "/home/user"}
}
// Returns basic suggestions without thinking analysis
```

### For Complex Commands  
Automatic structured thinking activation:
```json
{
  "intent": "implement microservice architecture with event sourcing",
  "context": {
    "project_type": "enterprise",
    "services": ["user", "order", "payment", "notification"]
  }
}
// Automatically applies structured thinking due to complexity
```

### Explicit Structured Thinking
Force structured thinking for any command:
```json
{
  "intent": "run tests",
  "context": {"test_type": "integration"},
  "use_structured_thinking": true
}
// Applies structured thinking regardless of complexity
```

## üìä Performance Benefits

- Questions: "What similar problems have been solved before?"
- Memory queries: Suggested searches for relevant patterns

**Analysis Stage:**
- Focus: "Break down the problem into manageable components"
- Questions: "What are the core components of this problem?"
- Considerations: Technical complexity, resource requirements, time constraints

**Synthesis Stage:**
- Focus: "Combine research and analysis to develop solution approaches" 
- Questions: "What solution approach best fits the constraints?"
- Output format: "Prioritized list of solution approaches"

### Learning Insights Generation
Extract learning insights from structured thinking analysis:

```json
{
  "structured_approach_applied": true,
  "thinking_stages_used": 3,
  "research_depth": 5,
  "component_analysis_depth": 4,
  "learning_recommendations": [
    "Continue using structured thinking for complex problems",
    "Build on identified patterns in future sessions", 
    "Document thinking process for knowledge retention"
  ]
}
```

This comprehensive enhancement transforms AutoCode from a simple command suggestion tool into an intelligent structured thinking system that approaches coding problems with systematic methodology while maintaining high performance and accuracy.
