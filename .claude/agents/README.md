### Memory Strategy by Agent

**Feature Development Agent Memory**:
- **High Importance (0.8-0.9)**: Architectural decisions, component reuse patterns, integration insights
- **Medium Importance (0.6-0.7)**: Implementation details, testing strategies, documentation patterns
- **Tags**: project_name, technology_stack, component_type, pattern_type

**Code Quality Agent Memory**:
- **Critical (0.9)**: Security vulnerabilities, data exposure risks, authentication flaws
- **High (0.8)**: Code review patterns, performance bottlenecks, architecture consistency issues
- **Tags**: security_domain, vulnerability_type, quality_dimension, resolution_strategy

**Context Intelligence Agent Memory**:
- **Project State (0.9)**: Critical milestones, architecture evolution, team coordination patterns
- **Workflow Patterns (0.8)**: Successful workflows, optimization strategies, productivity patterns
- **Tags**: project_phase, workflow_type, optimization_area, team_coordination
