## Using Memory with Claude

MCP AlunAI Memory enables Claude to remember information across conversations without requiring explicit commands, while AutoCodeIndex provides intelligent code assistance.

### üß† **Automatic Memory Features**
Claude will automatically:
- Remember important details you share about projects and preferences
- Store user preferences, facts, and coding patterns
- Recall relevant information when needed
- Track file modifications and command usage
- Learn from successful workflows and approaches

### üöÄ **AutoCodeIndex Intelligence**
Claude gains powerful code intelligence capabilities:
- **Smart Command Suggestions**: Get context-aware command recommendations
- **Project Pattern Recognition**: Automatic detection of frameworks and architectures
- **Session Continuity**: Resume work with relevant context from previous sessions
- **Learning Tracking**: Monitor your progress on specific technologies and topics
- **Workflow Optimization**: Receive suggestions based on successful past patterns

### üí¨ **Memory Recall**
To see what Claude remembers, simply ask:
- "What do you remember about me?"
- "What projects have we worked on?"
- "Show me my learning progression in React"
- "What command patterns work best for this project?"

### ‚úÖ **Verifying AutoCodeIndex is Active**
Once enabled, you'll immediately notice:
- **Command suggestions with confidence scores**: "Based on your project, I suggest `npm test` (95% success rate)"
- **Automatic project analysis**: "I've detected a React + TypeScript project with Jest testing"
- **Session continuity**: "Continuing from our work 3 days ago on the authentication system..."
- **Learning insights**: "You've progressed from basic React to advanced patterns like custom hooks"

**Quick verification**: Ask "Show me AutoCodeIndex stats" to see system status and learning data.

### üõ† **Available Tools**
AutoCodeIndex provides 7 intelligent tools:
1. **suggest_command** - Get smart command suggestions based on intent
2. **get_project_patterns** - Analyze and retrieve project patterns
3. **find_similar_sessions** - Find related past work sessions
4. **get_continuation_context** - Get context for continuing tasks
5. **suggest_workflow_optimizations** - Improve workflows based on history
6. **get_learning_progression** - Track learning progress on topics
7. **autocode_stats** - View AutoCodeIndex system statistics

### üìù **System Prompt**
For optimal functionality, add this to your Claude system prompt:

```
This Claude instance has been enhanced with persistent memory and AutoCodeIndex
capabilities. Claude will automatically remember important details across
conversations, learn from coding patterns and command usage, and provide
intelligent assistance based on project context and historical data.
```
