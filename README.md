- Fast model option: ~3s initialization with paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2
- Connection recovery: Sub-second automatic failover

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Memory Triggers

The system automatically captures memories by default using the built in hooks functionaly.  However, if you want to trigger manual captures you can use these patterns:

#### Memory Storage Phrases
```
"Remember this: [content]"
"Store this information: [content]"
"Keep track of: [content]"
"Note that: [content]"
"Save this: [content]"
"Don't forget: [content]"
"Remember that." # Used if something important like a summary was in the previous response.
```

#### Procedural Thinking Triggers
Complex tasks automatically activate 5-stage sequential thinking:
> These are just examples, the system will trigger with many similar forms of expression.
```
"How should I approach..."              # Planning requests
"What steps do I need to..."            # Multi-step processes
"Help me design/implement/architect..." # Complex design tasks
"I need to systematically..."           # Systematic approach requests
"Break down this problem..."            # Problem decomposition
"Analyze and solve..."                  # Analysis requests
```

#### Memory Retrieval Phrases
These phrases trigger automatic memory consultation:
> These are just examples, the system will trigger with many similar forms of expression.
```
"What do you remember about..."
"Have we worked on this before..."
"Recall my preferences for..."
"What did we learn about..."
"Show me similar projects..."
"What patterns have we used..."
```

#### MCP Tool Discovery Phrases
These trigger automatic MCP server discovery and tool suggestions:
> Beta - this is still being developed, but works better than native.
```
"I need to query the database..."       # â†’ postgres MCP tools
"Let me browse this website..."         # â†’ playwright MCP tools
"I should run some SQL..."              # â†’ database MCP tools
"I need to test the API..."             # â†’ fetch/curl MCP tools
"Let me check the filesystem..."        # â†’ filesystem MCP tools
```

### Example Workflows

#### 1. Project Setup with Memory
```
User: "Remember this: I prefer using TypeScript with strict mode,
       ESLint with Airbnb config, and Jest for testing"

Claude: âœ… Stored memory: coding_preferences
        ðŸ§  This will be automatically referenced in future projects
```

#### 2. Complex Task Analysis
```
User: "Let's plan out a secure authentication system for our API"

Claude: ðŸ§  **PROCEDURAL THINKING ACTIVATED**

        Using sequential_thinking for systematic analysis:

        **Stage 1: Problem Analysis**
        - Authentication requirements analysis
        - Security threat modeling
        - API endpoint protection needs

        **Stage 2: Context Exploration**
        - Current system architecture review
        - Available auth frameworks
        - Security best practices

        [Continues through all 5 stages...]
```

#### 3. Automatic Memory Consultation
```
User: "I'm setting up a new React project"

Claude: ðŸ§  **Relevant memories found:**
        - Your TypeScript + ESLint preferences (stored 2 days ago)
        - React project structure patterns (from 3 similar projects)
        - Testing setup with Jest configuration

        Based on your preferences, I'll set up TypeScript with strict mode...
```

#### 4. MCP Tool Suggestions
```
User: "I need to query the user table to check account status"

Claude: ðŸ’¡ **MCP Tools Available:**
        - **postgres_query**: Execute SQL queries directly
        - **postgres_schema**: Get table schema information

        Instead of writing a script, let me use the postgres MCP tool:
        [Uses postgres_query tool directly]
```

### Automatic Patterns

#### Memory Auto-Capture Patterns
- **"Remember this:"** â†’ Stores as `user_preference` or `important_fact`
- **Code explanations** â†’ Stored as `code_pattern` or `solution_approach`
- **Project decisions** â†’ Stored as `architectural_decision`
- **Error solutions** â†’ Stored as `troubleshooting_solution`
- **Workflow improvements** â†’ Stored as `workflow_optimization`

#### Thinking Pattern Recognition
- **Long, complex requests** â†’ Triggers sequential thinking
- **Multiple "and" clauses** â†’ Activates systematic breakdown
- **Planning keywords** â†’ Enables structured analysis
- **Problem-solving context** â†’ Engages 5-stage process

#### MCP Tool Pattern Matching
- **Database terms** â†’ Suggests postgres/sqlite MCP tools
- **Web/browser terms** â†’ Suggests playwright/puppeteer tools
- **File operations** â†’ Suggests filesystem MCP tools
- **API testing** â†’ Suggests fetch/http MCP tools
- **Git operations** â†’ Suggests git MCP tools

Results:
- Automatic data integrity verification
- 100x+ performance improvement
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Rollback safety (original files unchanged)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Hanging operations**: Fixed with timeout protection and automatic recovery
- **"Instance is closed" errors**: Automatic detection and client recreation
- **Stale locks**: Automatic cleanup based on process validation

### Performance Issues
- **Slow initialization**: Use `fast_model` configuration option
- **Memory usage**: Check `qdrant_performance_stats` for optimization
- **Search performance**: Run `optimize_qdrant_collection`
